      <h1>
        Â¶ Hello World App ( 1-2-3 )
      </h1><br>
        Pyrails makes apps easy to write and maintain as the codebase grows.
        we maintain a "routes.py" that houses all our url routes , corresponding to which all functions exists
        We will quickly go through how to write "hello world" app.
        <h2>Step 1 :</h2>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">
            <strong>api/controllers/TestController.py</strong> It's a sample controller where you could write your logic
         </div>
         
        <textarea class="well well-sm form-control ">
        def hello():
              return "Hello World"
        </textarea>
        So basically within this controller we have defined hello that returns "Hello World". Obviously :)
         <p>
            <img src="/static/images/hello-world.png" class="img-responsive">
         </p>
         Refer to the image above in case you are new to everything.
         <br><Br>
        <h2>Step 2 :</h2>
        The final step would be to point a URL to this function which again is easy to do.<br>
        Just go to <code>config/routes.py</code> 
        and add the following code :<br>
        <br><div class="well well-sm">
           <code>'GET /hello' : TestController.hello</code>
        </div>
        So we are defining "/hello" as url that points to function hello which is present in TestController<br><br>
        <p>
           <img src="/static/images/routes.png" class="img-responsive">
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-warning">
            Now Run the app using : <strong>python app.py</strong> <br>
            Refer to "Getting Started to learn how to run the app"
        </div>

        <h2>Step 3 : (We are done )</h2>
        Make sure you have saved and RESTARTED your app for the new changes to take place.<br>
        <img src="/static/images/hello-url.png">
        <br>
        So that's it , We wrote a simple function in the controller , then wrote a simple URL "/hello" and made it poin to the controller and the function.
        We started our app and then visited the url "localhost:5000/hello" and bingo it worked.<br><br>
